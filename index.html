          Adventure travel is a type of niche tourism, involving exploration or
          travel with a certain degree of risk (real or perceived), and which
          may require special skills and physical exertion. In the United
          States, adventure tourism has grown in recent decades as tourists seek
          out-of-the-ordinary or "roads less traveled" vacations, but lack of a
          clear operational definition has hampered measurement of market size
          and growth. According to the U.S.-based Adventure Travel Trade
          Association, adventure travel may be any tourist activity that
          includes physical activity, a cultural exchange, and connection with
          nature.

          Adventure tourists may have the motivation to achieve mental states
          characterized as rush or flow, resulting from stepping outside their
          comfort zone. This may be from experiencing culture shock or by
          performing acts requiring significant effort and involve some degree
          of risk, real or perceived, or physical danger. This may include
          activities such as mountaineering, trekking, bungee jumping, mountain
          biking, cycling, canoeing, scuba diving, rafting, kayaking,
          zip-lining, paragliding, hiking, exploring, canyoneering,
          sandboarding, caving and rock climbing. Some obscure forms of
          adventure travel include disaster and ghetto tourism. Other rising
          forms of adventure travel include social and jungle tourism.

          <h2 class="desc">Biking</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Biking is an activity that involves a bicycle. You can ride the bike
          on a road, bike path, a mountain trail, or rough terrain. Some use the
          term “biking” to refer specifically to a mountain biking context, and
          it is often associated with riding a heavy duty bicycle on rougher
          terrain. Mountain biking usually takes place on mountain trails, dirt
          roads, or parks. It first originated as a sport in California, United
          States. The first bikers who engaged in the sport used a type of bike
          called cruiser bicycles. This single-speed bicycle comes with balloon
          tyres and an upright seating posture. It has fewer gears, which make
          it the perfect bike when you want to simply enjoy riding without
          thinking about what gears to control. Nowadays, people who engage in
          mountain biking and off-the-road biking use mountain bikes.

          Mountain biking is a sport that uses a bicycle but is done on rough
          terrain. It is sometimes simply referred to as biking. It involves
          different categories, such as free riding, dirt jumping, downhill,
          trail riding, and cross country. Mountain bikes are constructed
          differently from normal bicycles. Designed to endure rough terrain,
          mountain bikes have flat and wider handle bars, lower gear ratios,
          off-road tyres that provide more traction, and suspension forks.

          <h2 class="desc">Para Gliding</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
          harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric
          wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure
          of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
          forces of the air flowing over the outside.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="desc">Surfing</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools.
          <br />
          <br />
          The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board,
          regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche
          of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
          the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
          Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
          modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding
          a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up
          surfing.
